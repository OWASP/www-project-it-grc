### **Introduction**

This project provides you a GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) platform focused to manage Cybersecurity risks and control design.

With this platform you can comply with ISO 27001:2022, PCI and others requirements, also you can implement an Information Security Management System, execute IT Risk analysis and evaluation, design controls, get reports, and more.

Demonstrate trust to your customers, stakeholders and regulators, and stay compliant with cybersecurity frameworks.

### **Asset Management**

You can not protect what you do not know, so in this module you can register IT providers, IT components, IT systems, processess and critical data, so you can evaluate risk and desing controls over such components to protect you data and mitigate cybersecurity risks.

### **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**

The platform provide you with the 93 ISO 27001:2022 controls already loaded, security attributues, security concepts, categories, so you basically need to complete the statement aplicability to show an Information Security Management System implemented in your organization.

### **Risk Management**

Also you can evaluate risks using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Score System) calculator integrated in the risk module.

You can evaluate risk factors and design the controls to mitigate risks.

### **Control**

Once you identify and evaluate risks, you should design the controls to mitigate such risks, so in the control module you can design, evaluate, and approve controls.
Each control has a flow (draft, designed, implemented, approved), so the controls can be audited and evaluated to ensure they are effective to mitigate risks.

### **Compliance**

Stay compliant with cybersecurity frameworks. The platform also can be used to show compliance with legal, external or other compliance requirements like PCI, NIST, CIS Controls and OWASP.
